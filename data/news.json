But a brutal week revealed he hasn’t delivered it, and his failure to lead with vision may be his undoing</p><p>“Nothing is inevitable until it happens,” wrote AJP&nbsp;Taylor, rejecting the idea that history unfolds according to a plan. Taylor distrusted grand visions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/04/labour-rachel-reeves-prime-minister-treasury-country-leadership\">Sir Keir Starmer</a> seems afraid to have one. A year into power, the prime minister doesn’t act like a man chosen by history, but one hoping to avoid its glare. Modern politics shifts quickly and governing as if nothing has changed is a risk. Yet Sir Keir treats pragmatism as principle and surrounds himself with advisers recycling <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/03/starmer-labour-blair-election-britain-tories-optimism/\">New Labour-era</a> habits: technocracy, market deference and<a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/comment/one-year-labour-economy\"> fiscal discipline</a>.</p><p>In a world of Trumpian <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/event/brave-new-disorder-the-trumpian-shock-to-the-world-and-europe/\">shocks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2025/06/what-keir-starmer-cant-say\">geopolitical</a> realignments, that strategy risks looking less like responsible government than crippling rigidity.

Retreating to the relative safety of the global stage is no substitute for leadership. Sir Keir cuts a confident figure abroad. At home, the instincts stumble. When a rebellion gutted his own government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/01/welfare-bill-passes-after-keir-starmer-offers-late-concession\">disability benefit cuts</a>, he blamed his failure to grip the issue on being “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/29/keir-starmer-lost-grip-labour-welfare-revolt-focus-foreign-affairs\">heavily focused</a>” on foreign affairs.

    "summary": "<p>The bill steals from the sick, elderly and hungry, and gives to billionaires and jackboots. But Republicans will follow their leader anywhere</p><p>The budget reconciliation bill that passed the US House of Representatives on Thursday and was promptly to be signed into law by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> represents the particular perversity of national politics in America: seemingly no one wants it, everyone hates it, and it is widely agreed to be devastating for staggering numbers of Americans. And yet, the bill felt inevitable: it was a foregone conclusion that this massive, malignant measure was something that everyone dreaded and no one had the capacity to stop.</p><p>They didn’t really even try. In the Senate, a few conservative Republicans made noise about the bill’s dramatic costs: the congressional budget office estimates that the bill will <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-big-beautiful-gop-taxes-ced365c347de9320eef2ccb8df16dda2\">add $3.3 tn</a> to the deficit over the coming decade, and the senator Rand Paul, a budget hawk from Kentucky, declined to vote for it for this reason. But other Republicans, who used to style themselves as fiscally responsible guardians against excessive government spending, engaged in a bit of freelance creative accounting in order to produce an estimate that falsely claimed the cost of the bill would be lower. Most of them quickly found themselves on board.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/04/trump-devastating-budget-bill\">Continue reading...</a>",

The bond traders who forced out Liz Truss’s hapless chancellor still clearly rate her judgment and want her to stay, even if (perhaps especially if) some Labour MPs don’t. Yet it is an extraordinary thing to live with the knowledge that a moment’s uncontrolled emotion can drive up the cost of a nation’s mortgages, just as a misjudged stroke of the budget pen can destroy lives.</p><p>The most striking thing about her tears, however, was <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/25286510.keir-starmer-defends-failure-address-rachel-reevess-tears-pmqs/\">Starmer’s failure to notice</a>. Intent on the Tory benches opposite, the prime minister simply ploughed on, not realising that his closest political ally was dissolving beside him. Though within hours, a clearly mortified Starmer had thrown a metaphorical arm around her, and Reeves herself was back out talking up her beloved fiscal rules as if nothing had happened. But it’s the kind of image that sticks: her distress and his oblivion, an unfortunately convenient metaphor for all the times he has seemed oddly detached from his own government.</p><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/04/labour-rachel-reeves-prime-minister-treasury-country-leadership\">Continue reading...</a>",
