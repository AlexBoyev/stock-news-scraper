Where the anxious and the uncertain might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing\">seemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT</a>.

Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young Chinese are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/china-fortune-tellers-young-people-mysticism\">turning to ancient forms of divination</a> to find out what the future holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongside <em>xuanxue</em><em>, </em>or spiritualism. The trend makes sense: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/17/china-consumption-economy-trump-tariffs\">China’s economy is struggling</a>, and although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper than other forms of retail therapy or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/22/ai-therapy-therapist-chatbot-taiwan-china-mental-health\">an actual therapist</a>. With a deep-rooted culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/05/trip-beijng-fortune-telling-bar-china\">Continue reading...</a>",

But a brutal week revealed he hasn’t delivered it, and his failure to lead with vision may be his undoing</p><p>“Nothing is inevitable until it happens,” wrote AJP&nbsp;Taylor, rejecting the idea that history unfolds according to a plan. Taylor distrusted grand visions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/04/labour-rachel-reeves-prime-minister-treasury-country-leadership\">Sir Keir Starmer</a> seems afraid to have one. A year into power, the prime minister doesn’t act like a man chosen by history, but one hoping to avoid its glare. Modern politics shifts quickly and governing as if nothing has changed is a risk. Yet Sir Keir treats pragmatism as principle and surrounds himself with advisers recycling <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/03/starmer-labour-blair-election-britain-tories-optimism/\">New Labour-era</a> habits: technocracy, market deference and<a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/comment/one-year-labour-economy\"> fiscal discipline</a>.</p><p>In a world of Trumpian <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/event/brave-new-disorder-the-trumpian-shock-to-the-world-and-europe/\">shocks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2025/06/what-keir-starmer-cant-say\">geopolitical</a> realignments, that strategy risks looking less like responsible government than crippling rigidity.

Retreating to the relative safety of the global stage is no substitute for leadership. Sir Keir cuts a confident figure abroad. At home, the instincts stumble. When a rebellion gutted his own government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/01/welfare-bill-passes-after-keir-starmer-offers-late-concession\">disability benefit cuts</a>, he blamed his failure to grip the issue on being “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/29/keir-starmer-lost-grip-labour-welfare-revolt-focus-foreign-affairs\">heavily focused</a>” on foreign affairs.

In the Senate, a few conservative Republicans made noise about the bill’s dramatic costs: the congressional budget office estimates that the bill will <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-big-beautiful-gop-taxes-ced365c347de9320eef2ccb8df16dda2\">add $3.3 tn</a> to the deficit over the coming decade, and the senator Rand Paul, a budget hawk from Kentucky, declined to vote for it for this reason.

Intent on the Tory benches opposite, the prime minister simply ploughed on, not realising that his closest political ally was dissolving beside him. Though within hours, a clearly mortified Starmer had thrown a metaphorical arm around her, and Reeves herself was back out talking up her beloved fiscal rules as if nothing had happened.
